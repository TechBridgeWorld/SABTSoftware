/**
 * @brief The SABT's main routine.
 * @return void, but should never return.
 * @bug Handling of cancel is erratic depending on whether
 * an mp3 is *believed* to be playing.
 *
 * Initializes the system by resetting flags, checking modes,
 * etc. (This used to read in the dictionary; now it doesn't.)
 * Interrupt handlers are set to flip bools if the timer has
 * gone off, if data has been received from the UI, and if
 * data has been received from the PC.
 * 
 * Then, in an infinite loop:
 * 1. If the UI interrupt handler has been called, data has
 * been received from the user interface; store it and note
 * whether a complete message has been received.
 * 2. If the PC interrupt handler has been called, data has
 * been received from the PC; store it and note whether a
 * complete message has been received.
 * 3. If the timer interrupt has been called, setting the
 * timer bool to true, reset it to false. (This has no effect.)
 * 4. If there is a complete message from the PC, respond to it.
 * (If it was type x, send an ACK; if it was M, update modes
 * accordingly.)
 * 5. If there is a complete message from the UI board, take action.
 * Many of these actions depend on whether the user is in a mode
 * or the main menu, and whether an mp3 is playing. NOTE: playing_sound
 * is set to true when the MCU begins sending the mp3 file to the
 * sound card, and set to false when it finishes sending the file.
 * This does not necessarily correspond to actual play time.
 *

 *  Volume down                  |   Decrement volume
 *  Short cancel, mp3 is playing |   Stop the mp3
 *  Long cancel                  |   Quit back to main menu

 *  Enter                        |   Send "Yes" to mode
 *  Short cancel, no mp3 playing |   Send "No" to mode
 *  Dot or cell, no mp3 playing  |   Send to current mode
 *  Dot or cell, mp3 playing     |   No action
 * 
 * 6. Run one step of the currently active mode.
 * 7. If there's a queued mp3, play it.
