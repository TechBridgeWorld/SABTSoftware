Older modes (MD1,3,4,5,11) need to be standardized. They don't use the standard IO library, audio libraries or script libraries. There's loads of code redundancy in those modes.

There's scaffolding in place for word and sentence entry in the IO library. Don't know if it makes sense to develop those for the primary interface board with only one cell. Might make more sense to develop those for the intermediate and advanced boards.

It makes sense to make the animal game into a template like MD2 or something so that we can add general libraries of words to teach in a similar way. Might even be a SD card configurable option.

Look to create a blank game, that responds to values in a file on the SD card. The idea is that we cannot infinitely add new games to the main board, due to lack of memory.  What we need instead is a blank FSM that can read controls from an SD card file to move through states, store values, and play sound files.  Would allow for app development community. 

User logging is a feature that the needs assessment team on iSTEP 2013 strongly advocated for. This would consist of two possible major components: a way for users to log in with a Braille code and a logging module that logs modes used, time spent on modes and progression through modes over time. For higher level modes, it is useful to log in-mode performance data as well.
IO standardisation is not complete. Hangman and 2 player hangman do not adhere to any of the other modes yet. re: IO library re: README.io

The Intermediate and Advanced user interface boards need to be developed in their entirety.

Users have expressed interest in two different voices - one for input and one for output. This would involve recording one voice (preferably masculine) for all of the prompts and instructions given by the device, and a second voice (ideally feminine) to echo user input. For example, The instructions for Letter Practice and the letter prompts should be in the first voice, while the voice echoing the dot input should be the second voice.

Users have expressed interest in a mode that serves as a reference for how to write each letter. In other words, this mode would be Letter Practice without any user input - it would just read out how to form each letter. This could potentially be done by using the mode select buttons to scroll between letters instead of reading out eery letter.

Sentence writing practice - This could be a feature especially for the Intermediate and Advanced boards which have slate rows.

One player hangman could be set up to use a random word from the entire dictionary as opposed to the fixed current list we provide.

Contractions mode needs further development, left with a skeleton implementation not covering all contraction patterns (The rule sheet and documentation would give more detail on what to be implemented)
